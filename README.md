## Scripting
SERP will have full scripting support - which makes it easier to apply changes relevant to one company only, and without any BS.
Scripting is essential in this software, pre-shipped server files have the absolute core in them, ready for changes and additions as they're needed.

Server - Client Scripting
The advanced approach is to enable scripting support server-side inside the clients.
Given that one GUI needs a extra step of something when printing out an label/bill? do what u gotta do event-wise (OnOrderCompleted, OnLabelPrint)..

..more to come.
